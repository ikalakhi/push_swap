# push_swap
 One of the algorithm projects I unlocked (on may journey in 42 Network) is called Push_Swap. The idea is simple,
 You have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers. 
 You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. 
 There are only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to call “Actions”. 
 The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.
